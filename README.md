# Market Research Project

This project involves using various market research methods such as RFM analysis, customer segmentation, and clustering to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. The project aims to help businesses better understand their target audience and make informed decisions.

### 🧭 Project Overview

This project follows the following tasks:

1. Load the data into the project environment
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
3. Conduct RFM analysis to segment customers based on their behavior
4. Perform customer segmentation using demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data
5. Use clustering algorithms to group customers based on their similarities
6. Evaluate the results using appropriate metrics
7. Visualize the findings and draw insights

### ⏱️ Estimated time needed: 3h

Note: The time estimation may vary depending on your setup and previous experience.
